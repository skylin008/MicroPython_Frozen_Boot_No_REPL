# MicroPython_Frozen_Boot_No_REPL
This repo provides a brief tutorial on how to set up MicroPython to boot and run a single or series of modules that are frozen into the firmware in addition to disabling the REPL.  This can be useful if you have a project that you do not want to allow a user to mod a boot.py or main.py on the file system and have the entire application frozen into the firmware in addition to removing the REPL to keep a user from examining the internals of the firmware.  This is an advanced usage of MicroPython and this repo is designed to help a developer with a workflow to provide some basic security if your application calls for such a feature.
